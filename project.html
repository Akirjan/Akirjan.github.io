    <p><span class="bold">Aims: </span>
        The homicide rate in the US is more than seven times greater than in other 
        industrialised economies. In 2020, nearly 
        <a href="https://econofact.org/gun-violence-in-the-u-s">80 percent</a> of US homicides involved firearms. 
        Therefore, this project aims to answer why the US is one of the worst high-income countries in 
        preventing firearm mortality, whilst highlighting the importance of the arms industry within the US labour market. 
        
       </p>


         <h3> The concern over gun violence</h3>

    <!--First chart on opinions on gun violence in the US-->   
    <p> 
        I used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11WSIFXMrXfnXTSIeh7Irct1LCoMN6CsH?usp=sharing">Python</a> 
        to scrape data from the 
        <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/PP_2021.04.15_biden-100-days_REPORT.pdf">Pew Research Centre</a> 
        which showcased gun violence as a very problematic issue for nearly half of the American population (48 percent). 
        
    </p>    
        
        
      <div class= "chart" id="Chart32"></div>  


        <p>
            This chart shows that even during the Coronavirus pandemic, 
            in April 2021, Americans regarded gun violence as more of a “very big problem” 
            compared to the viral outbreak. This research will now demonstrate my investigation 
            into the causes behind the concerns of gun violence. 
        </p>


  <!--Second chart on gun deaths across the G7 countries from 1996 to 2019.-->      

        <p>
            In order to examine and compare the US’s high rates of gun violence,
             I used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BgEF47mxhQfSiMqkVy13Tl_ZM11I8SyI?usp=sharing">Python</a> 
             to batch download <a href="https://www.gunpolicy.org/api">API</a> links on the firearm related death rates
              for the world’s largest advanced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">economies</a> – the G7 countries. 
           
           
        </p>      
        
        <div class= "chart" id="Chart26"></div>  

        <p>
            In contrast to the other G7 countries, the US has had more than double the death rate from firearms across the years.
             The reason for the missing data is that the API source can only display data for the most recent year for which the
              data has been published. Some countries often lag several years behind high-capacity countries such as the US.
               Others (perhaps France) are waiting for the API source to undergo their ongoing country-by-country data sweeps.
                Furthermore, data from low-capacity countries are only published erratically. Since this dataset required cleaning,
                 this visualisation does not benefit from a quick and reliable automatic update when the API source updates. 
        </p>
    
        <p> 
            To understand the associated economic costs of US gun violence,
             I attempted to scrape the webpage <a href="https://everystat.org/">EveryStat</a>.
              However, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403">403 Forbidden</a> 
              error code denied my request of wanting to scrape the website.
               Therefore, I inspected the network activity to find an
               <a href="https://everystat.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/A.6.Landscape_cost_by_state-06-27-22.txt">external data source</a>,
                and I utilised the “Get Data” function in Excel to scrape this data and cleaned it in 
                <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yBAopZxdH82U64LdKsxnTLI81IIbdX8R?usp=sharing">Python</a>.

        </p>
        
        
  <!--Third chart on the economic cost of firearm deaths.-->      
        
  
        <div class="chart" id="Chart27"> </div>
        
        <p>
            This chart outlines a map of the US and illustrates that the average economic cost per capita amounts to $557.2 billion each year.
             The cost of gun violence ranges from police investigations to the quality of life lost and is approximately 
             <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/report/the-economic-cost-of-gun-violence/">2.6 percent</a> 
             of the annual US gross domestic product (GDP). 
        </p>


        <h3> Potential correlations</h3>

        <p>
            To leverage the restrictive and permissive gun laws across states,
             I utilised the gun-friendly index data from <a href="https://www.az-defenders.com/best-states-for-gun-owners/">AZ-Defenders</a>.
              I inspected the network activity to find a <a href="https://www.1point21interactive.com/maps/ag/friendliest-gun-owner-states.html">subpage</a> 
              and merged this dataset with the 
              <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm">CDC</a> firearm death rate data.               
            
        </p> 
            
            
          
  <!--Fourth chart on gun deaths and gun friendly index.-->      
        <div class="chart" id="Chart28"> </div>
        
        <p>
            The regression in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19NbWYfy1-dz4BxKsTRQMDoGoBMOHb9hL?usp=sharing">Python</a> 
            illustrates a one unit increase in the gun-friendly index results in a 0.15 
            rise in death rate per 100,000. As expected, a state with lenient gun laws tend to 
            have higher firearm mortality. The authors based the gun-friendly index on various 
            factors ranging from how lenient the background checks are to the state-level gun culture. 
            An R^2 of 0.50 suggests that 50 percent of the variability in the death rate is explained by the gun-friendly index. 
            
            
        </p>

        <p>
            The restrictive firearm regulations would impact the gun ownership level across states.
             Hence, I scraped data from the webpage 
             <a href="https://wisevoter.com/state-rankings/gun-ownership-by-state/">Wisevoter</a> using 
             <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/119HS6kHMWJuUL33lY8c2pPYL-J9299YK?usp=sharing">Python</a> to establish a potential
              firearm relationship between mortality and ownership.            
        
        </p>
    
    
  <!--Fifth chart on gun deaths and gun ownership.-->      
    <div class="chart" id="Chart29"> </div>
        
        <p> 
            This regression demonstrates that a one percent increase in firearm ownership increases
             the death rate per 100,000 by 0.31 and has a higher R^2 of 0.55. 

        </p>

        <p>
            For the final correlation, I wanted to establish whether a highly 
            educated population affects firearm mortality. I regressed the death rate on the percentage of people with a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_educational_attainment">bachelor’s</a> 
            degree or higher and also included data on the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_median_wage_and_mean_wage">average income</a> per state.
            
        </p>    


  <!--Sixth chart on gun deaths and education/income-->      
     <div class="chart" id="Chart30"> </div>
        
        <p>
            The <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wzyJhql38Vjlma8KhZ8YMTiaTEChtNW1?usp=sharing">Python</a> 
            regression analysis indicates a negative relationship between education and death rate,
             and between income and death rate. However, as expected, there is a positive correlation 
             between education and income. 
            
        </p>

       
       <h3>The importance of the arms industry</h3>
       
            <p>
                A solution to firearm mortality may be to prohibit gun sales. However, the arms industry was important to the US GDP of 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States">$22,996.1 billion</a>, 
                contributing a total of $70.52 billion in 2021. To access this data, I scraped a PDF report by 
                <a href="https://www.nssf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-Firearm-Ammunition-Industry-Economic-Impact.pdf">NSSF</a> using 
                <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VQ7WW980YwJ4o16Uj6c_zVVQj4sG26wI?usp=sharing">Python</a>. 
            
            </p>
                
          
  <!--Seventh chart employment from gun production-->      
      <div class="chart" id="Chart31"> </div>

        <p>
            In 2021, the US had a total of 6,300,000 people unemployed. 
            Therefore, the 375,819 jobs provided in this sector with an average wage of $56,900
             is crucial for the livelihood of these Americans. Finally, a substantial contribution
              of approximately $4.6 billion is funded through federal taxes for government expenditure. 
        </p>

  
        <p><span class="bold">Conclusion:</span>
            The influence of the arms industry on the labour market may be
             considered minimal in relation to the damage caused by firearms.
              Whilst this supports the abolition of gun sales, this could induce
               other criminal activity and further study is needed to weigh the cost and benefits of ceasing firearm sales.
