    <p><span class="bold">Aims: </span>
         A summer internship in the Crisis Management team at Aspen Insurance LTD enlightened me to the disturbing statistics surrounding gun violence in the US. 
         In 2019, <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2021/10/why-more-shootings-in-america-gun-violence-data-research/">11.1</a> out of every 100,000 Americans were killed by guns which was more than triple the global rate of 3. 
         This prompts the question as to why the US is one of the worst high-income countries in controlling the negative externalities caused from firearms.  
         This project will provide a background on the underlying statistics and costs that are directly 
         associated to gun violence, before attempting to discover potential correlations to explain these horrific figures. 
         Finally, this project will present the importance of gun production to the US labour market. </p>

    <!--First chart on opinions on gun violence in the US-->   
    <p> It is a general American concensus that  
        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11WSIFXMrXfnXTSIeh7Irct1LCoMN6CsH?usp=sharing">Python</a> 
        to batch download several <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/">API</a> links which demonstrate the death rate of the G7 countries. 
        In order to compare against the US, a high-income country, I specifically chose the G7 countries which make up the world’s largest IMF advanced 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">economies</a>. Once I attained the different API links for each country, I had to clean the data before 
        merging individual datasets into a master dataset and made the corresponding line chart below. </p>
 

        <div class= "chart" id="Chart32"></div>  



  <!--Second chart on gun deaths across the G7 countries from 1996 to 2019.-->      

        <p> To illustrate why the main focus is on the US, I used 
            <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BgEF47mxhQfSiMqkVy13Tl_ZM11I8SyI?usp=sharing">Python</a> 
            to batch download several <a href="https://www.gunpolicy.org/api">API</a> links which demonstrate the death rate of the G7 countries. 
            In order to compare against the US, a high-income country, I specifically chose the G7 countries which make up the world’s largest IMF advanced 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">economies</a>. Once I attained the different API links for each country, I had to clean the data before 
            merging individual datasets into a master dataset and made the corresponding line chart below. </p>
        
        <div class= "chart" id="Chart26"></div>  

        <p> In comparison to the other G7 countries, the US has had more than double the death rate from firearms across the years - reaching a high of 12.21 per 100,000 in 2017.
             Upon inspection, several data points are missing for countries between 1996 and 2019, hence I contacted those responsible for this API source. 
             The reasoning behind the missing data points is that they can only display data for the most recent year for which it’s been published. Some countries lag one year, 
             and often several years behind high-capacity countries such as the US. Others (perhaps France) may be waiting their turn to be searched in one of our ongoing country-by-country data sweeps. 
             Data from many low-capacity countries is only published erratically and may not show a continuous time series. 
             Finally, this visualisation does not benefit from the API automation given the need to clean the dataset. 
             Hence, the chart above does not automatically change when the controllers of the API update their dataset. </p>
    
        <p> Now to understand the costs associated with gun violence in the US, I attempted to scrape the website <a href="https://everystat.org/">"Every Stat"</a>, 
            which demonstrated the per capita cost of firearm injuries each year using a web scraping tool called beautiful-soup in Python. 
            However, in this process, I ran into a web scraping protection error code <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403">"403 Forbidden"</a>, 
            which denied authorising my request of wanting to scrape the website. Therefore, I inspected the network’s activity to find an external source for the data. 
            Hence, I utilised the “Get Data” function from Excel to scrape this data and cleaned it in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yBAopZxdH82U64LdKsxnTLI81IIbdX8R?usp=sharing">Python</a>.
        
        </p>
        
        




  <!--Second chart on the economic cost of firearm deaths.-->      
        
  
        <div class="chart" id="Chart27"> </div>
        
        <p>The chart above outlines a map of the US, which was formed using the relative position of each state in space.
            The data presented on the map shows that the average per capita cost each year is highest in Alaska with a cost of $3,397 and lowest in Massachusetts with a cost of $503 of all firearm injuries. 
            This visualisation also demonstrates the breakdown of this total economic cost. 
            Clearly the effects of gun violence is affecting everyone in America, with some states having a bigger economic toll than other states. 
            So to identify what the root of this continuously high death rate is in the US, I will now demonstrate several potential correlations that could explain this.</p>

        <p>First, I leveraged the restrictive and permissive gun laws across states to establish a potential correlation with death rates in the US. 
            In order to do this, I inspected the network’s activity of the webpage ‘ <a href="https://www.az-defenders.com/best-states-for-gun-owners/">AZ-Defenders</a>’ 
            to find that the map I wanted to scrape was on a <a href="https://www.1point21interactive.com/maps/ag/friendliest-gun-owner-states.html">subpage</a>, and after checking the source of this page, 
            I found where the data was loaded from. I saved this data as a ‘json’ file, and this was merged with the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm">death rate</a> 
            in each state in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19NbWYfy1-dz4BxKsTRQMDoGoBMOHb9hL?usp=sharing">Python</a>.</p>
   
  
  <!--Third chart on gun deaths and gun friendly index.-->      
        <div class="chart" id="Chart28"> </div>
        
        <p>The regression clearly illustrates a positive correlation between death rates and the gun friendly index in the US. 
            To establish the index of each state, the authors ranked the states based on various factors ranging from how lenient states are with background checks to buy firearms, 
            to the general acceptance of guns in each state. As expected, a state with more lenient gun laws tend to have a higher death rate. 
            An R2 of 0.50 suggest that 50 percent of the variability in the death rate is explained by the gun friendly index.</p>

        <p>The restrictive norms and regulations would impact the gun ownership level across state. 
            Hence, I utilised this to establish a potential relationship between death rate from firearms and the ownership of guns. 
            I scraped data using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/119HS6kHMWJuUL33lY8c2pPYL-J9299YK?usp=sharing">Python</a> from 
            <a href="https://wisevoter.com/state-rankings/gun-ownership-by-state/">'Wisevoter'</a> 
            and merged it with the death rate dataset to make the following visualisation.</p>
    
    
  <!--Fourth chart on gun deaths and gun ownership.-->      
    <div class="chart" id="Chart29"> </div>
        
        <p> This regression also demonstrates a positive relationship, but with a higher R2 of 0.55. 
            This suggests that more of the variability in death rate is explained by the firearm ownership. 
            Given the difference in ownership in guns, one might wonder if individuals are educated to use such a damaging weapon.</p>

        <p>To showcase this, I used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wzyJhql38Vjlma8KhZ8YMTiaTEChtNW1?usp=sharing">Python</a> to web scrape data on whether having a population with more educated people affects the death rate from firearms. 
            Hence, I regressed percentage of people that have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_educational_attainment">bachelor’s degree</a> or higher against death rate, 
            and also introduced a third variable of comparison in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_median_wage_and_mean_wage">average income</a> per state.</p>


  <!--Fifth chart on gun deaths and education/income-->      
     <div class="chart" id="Chart30"> </div>
        
        <p>There is a clear negative relationship between educational level and death rate, 
            which could imply that those in more educated areas have a greater understanding of the costs and negative externalities associated with gun mortality. 
            As expected, the higher average income states have a higher proportion of individuals with a bachelor’s degree or higher. More interestingly, 
            another negative relationship is established with higher earning states experiencing fewer firearm mortality.</p>

        <p>Whilst it may seem obvious that the solution to reduce gun violence would be to stop the production and sales of guns. 
            However, the firearm and ammunition industry is important contributor to the 2021 GDP of the US which amounted to 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States">22,996.1 billion</a>. To illustrate the economic output from the firearm industry, 
            I scraped a PDF from the website <a href="https://www.nssf.org/government-relations/impact/">‘NSSF’</a> using 
            <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VQ7WW980YwJ4o16Uj6c_zVVQj4sG26wI?usp=sharing">Python</a>.</p>
  
  
  <!--Sixth chart employment from gun production-->      
      <div class="chart" id="Chart31"> </div>

        <p>The total economic output from the arms industry amounts to 70.52 billion which contributed to 0.3% of the 2021 US GDP. 
            Furthermore, its contribution towards the number of jobs provided and the associated wages would all be detrimental to the lives of 
            the individuals that rely on this as their main source of income. Finally, whilst it provides employability to the citizens, it is 
            also paying the government via federal taxes and all these factors would be lost if the industry ceases to exist.</p>

  
        <p><span class="bold">Conclusion:</span>
            In conclusion, I have demonstrated the horrific figures that are related to the gun violence in the US and formed 
            potential correlations to explain this behaviour. I have also enlightened this project from a different perspective 
            into understanding the detrimental effect the closure of the arms industry could be on the economy. </p>
