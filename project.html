   <p class=title><span class="bold">Explaining gun violence in the US</span></p>
  

    <hr class="solid">
    
    <p><span class="bold">Aims: </span>
         An internship in the Crisis Management team at Aspen Insurance LTD enlightened me about the disturbing US gun violence statistics. 
         In 2019, <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2021/10/why-more-shootings-in-america-gun-violence-data-research/">11.1</a> out of every 100,000
         Americans were killed by guns which was more than triple the global rate of 3. 
         Therefore this project tackles the question as to why the US is one of the worst high-income countries in preventing firearm mortality, 
         whilst also highlighting the importance of the arms industry to the US labour market. 
       </p>


         <h3> The concern over gun violence</h3>

    <!--First chart on opinions on gun violence in the US-->   
    <p> I used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11WSIFXMrXfnXTSIeh7Irct1LCoMN6CsH?usp=sharing">Python</a> 
        to scrape the PDF file of this study by <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/">Pew Research Centre </a> 
        to show that gun violence is a very problematic issue for nearly half of the American population (48%). 
     
 

        <div class= "chart" id="Chart32"></div>  


        <p>
            This chart shows that during the peak of the Corona Virus in April 2021,
             Americans regarded gun violence as more of a “very big problem” than the outbreak of the virus. 
             I will now attempt to tackle the underlying reasoning behind these concerns. 
        </p>


  <!--Second chart on gun deaths across the G7 countries from 1996 to 2019.-->      

        <p>
            To illustrate why the US is the focus, I used  <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BgEF47mxhQfSiMqkVy13Tl_ZM11I8SyI?usp=sharing">Python</a> 
             to batch download <a href="https://www.gunpolicy.org/api">API</a> links on
             the firearm-caused death rates for the G7 countries. For comparative measures,
              I specifically chose the G7 countries which make up the world’s largest IMF advanced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">economies</a>. 
            
        
        <div class= "chart" id="Chart26"></div>  

        <p> In contrast to the other G7 countries, the US has had more than double the death rate
             from firearms across the years. The reason for the missing data is that the API source
              can only display data for the most recent year for which it’s been published.
               Some countries often lag several years behind high-capacity countries such as the US.
                Others (perhaps France) are waiting for the API source to undergo their ongoing country-by-country data sweeps.
                 Furthermore, data from low-capacity countries are only published erratically. Since this data required cleaning, this visualisation does not benefit from API automation,
                  thus the chart above does not automatically update when the API source updates. . </p>
    
        <p> 
            To understand the associated economic costs of US gun violence, I attempted to scrape <a href="https://everystat.org/">"Every Stat"</a>.
             However, I ran into the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403">"403 Forbidden"</a>
              error code which denied my request of wanting to scrape 
             the website. Therefore, I inspected the network’s activity to find an external source for the 
             data, and I utilised the “Get Data” function in Excel to scrape this data and cleaned it in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yBAopZxdH82U64LdKsxnTLI81IIbdX8R?usp=sharing">Python</a>.
        </p>
        
        




  <!--Third chart on the economic cost of firearm deaths.-->      
        
  
        <div class="chart" id="Chart27"> </div>
        
        <p>
            This chart outlines a map of the US and illustrates 
            the average economic per capita cost each year to range from $3,397 to $503 for all 
            firearm injuries. The visualisation also contains a breakdown of this total economic cost 
            and hence showcases that gun violence is a burden on all Americans.
        </p>


        <h3> Potential correlations</h3>

        <p>
            To leverage the restrictive and permissive gun law across states,
             I used the gun-friendly index from <a href="https://www.az-defenders.com/best-states-for-gun-owners/">AZ-Defenders</a>. 
             I inspected the networks activity to find a <a href="https://www.1point21interactive.com/maps/ag/friendliest-gun-owner-states.html">subpage</a>
              and merged 
             this data with the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm">CDC</a> death rate data in 
             <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19NbWYfy1-dz4BxKsTRQMDoGoBMOHb9hL?usp=sharing">Python</a>.
              
            
        </p> 
            
            
          
  <!--Fourth chart on gun deaths and gun friendly index.-->      
        <div class="chart" id="Chart28"> </div>
        
        <p>The regression in python illustrates a one unit increase in the gun-friendly index results in a 
            0.15 rise in death rate per 100,000. As expected, a state with more lenient gun laws tend to 
            have a higher death rate. To establish the gun-friendly index, the authors ranked the states 
            based on various factors ranging from how lenient the background checks are to the state-level 
            gun culture. An R2 of 0.50 suggests that 50 percent of the variability in the death rate is explained 
            by the gun-friendly index. 
        
        </p>

        <p>
            The restrictive firearm regulations would impact the gun ownership level 
            across states. Hence, I utilised this to establish a potential relationship 
            between firearm ownership and mortality. I scraped data using 
            <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/119HS6kHMWJuUL33lY8c2pPYL-J9299YK?usp=sharing">Python</a> from 
            <a href="https://wisevoter.com/state-rankings/gun-ownership-by-state/">'Wisevoter'</a>. 
            
        
        </p>
    
    
  <!--Fifth chart on gun deaths and gun ownership.-->      
    <div class="chart" id="Chart29"> </div>
        
        <p> 
            This regression demonstrates that a one percent increase in firearm ownership 
            increases the death rate per 100,000 by 0.31 and has a higher R2 of 0.55. 

        </p>

        <p>
            The final correlation I wanted to establish was whether having a more educated population 
            affects the death rate from firearms. I regressed the percentage of people that have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_educational_attainment">bachelor’s</a> 
            degree or higher against the death rate and also included data on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_median_wage_and_mean_wage">average income</a>
             per state.
            
        </p>    


  <!--Sixth chart on gun deaths and education/income-->      
     <div class="chart" id="Chart30"> </div>
        
        <p>
            The <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wzyJhql38Vjlma8KhZ8YMTiaTEChtNW1?usp=sharing">Python</a> 
            regression analysis shows negative relationships between education and death rate, 
            and between income and death rate. However, there is a positive correlation between income 
            and education. 
            
        </p>

       
       <h3>The importance of the arms industry</h3>
       
            <p>
                The solution to firearm mortality may be obvious by ceasing gun sales, however, 
                the arms industry was an important contributor to the 2021 US GDP of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States">22,996.1 billion</a>. 
                To illustrate the economic output from the firearm industry, I scraped a PDF file from <a href="https://www.nssf.org/government-relations/impact/">‘NSSF’</a> using 
                <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VQ7WW980YwJ4o16Uj6c_zVVQj4sG26wI?usp=sharing">Python</a>.
            
            
            
            </p>
                
          
  <!--Seventh chart employment from gun production-->      
      <div class="chart" id="Chart31"> </div>

        <p>
            The total economic output from the arms industry amounts to 70.52 billion - 
            0.3% of the 2021 US GDP. Furthermore, the arms industry provides jobs, wages and 
            government income through federal taxes. 
        </p>

  
        <p><span class="bold">Conclusion:</span>
            
            I have shown that gun violence is a concern to the US, 
            and established potential correlations in explaining this behaviour. 
            I have also demonstrated the importance of the arms industry to the US GDP.
